Generally, anomaly detection in recent researchs are based on the datasets get from pedestrian (likes UCSD, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, etc.)， or UCF-Crime (real-wrold anomaly).
However some focus on specefic scene as follows.

## Specific Scene
### Traffic

### Old-man Fall Down

### Fighting/Volence
1. Localization Guided Fight Action Detection in Survellance Videos. ICME 2019.
2. 

### Social/ Group Anomaly
1. Social-BiGAT: Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting using Bicycle-GAN and Graph Attention Networks, Neurips 2019.
